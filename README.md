- - data folder
- - notebooks<br>
### Gender classification
The **gender_classification folder**,  contains notebooks for data preprocessing, sparse matrix creation, training and necessary datasets.<br> 
Reason of different notebooks for data preprocessing and sparse matrix creation, is data preprocessing requires a lot of memory. After saving all necessary data you have to stop it and then run sparse matrix creation notebook.<br><br> 
**Note:** It is possible you will need to run for training and test data creation seperatly(shut down notebook after preprocessing of training or test data).
### CoLES: Contrastive Learning for Event Sequences with Self-Supervision 
The **CoLES** folder contains implementation of paper https://openreview.net/forum?id=tADlrawCrVU. <br/>
Notebook Contains as Neural Network as DataGenerator for it.
