## Gender classification
Currently repository contains data preprocessing and sparse matrix creation for gender classification task in **gender_classification folder**, which contains different notebooks for each task (data preprocessing and sparse matrix creation).<br> 
Reason of different notebooks is,data preprocessing requires a lot of memory. After saving all necessary data you have to stop it and then run sparse matrix creation notebook.<br><br> 
**Note:** It is possible you will need to run for training and test data creation seperatly(shut down notebook after preprocessing of training or test data) .
